								{" "}More recently, this laborious process was trusted by specialists. But thanks to modern materials and the latest developments, even a novice builder can handle this. Before proceeding with the final finishing, you will have to level the surface in the currently popular way. This is the plaster of the walls along the lighthouses. What will it take to work? To do the work efficiently with your own hands, you should purchase some materials and tools: Metal profiles or wooden bars. However, due to the fact that the latter are subject to decay, they are practically not used. A mixture for plastering, which is divided into two types: gypsum and cement. The choice will depend on the desire of the homeowner, but many experts advise using gypsum, as it has the best qualities. It does not shrink and cracks form on it. In addition, the gypsum mixture will serve as an additional plus when creating sound insulation and retaining heat. You will need a primer and a brush to apply. In addition, it is necessary to prepare spatulas of various sizes, screws, dowels and a building level.

								Methods A flat and smooth wall surface can be achieved by several methods: a putty suitable for a working area with small differences, as well as plasterboard sheathing with and without beacons. But this finish has a short lifespan. More practical and durable is such a method as monolithic plastering of the walls under the lighthouse. The meaning of the option is to apply a ready-made mortar of building mixtures directly to the walls and ceiling of the room. The positive qualities of the wet method include the fact that it is suitable for use on any surfaces in rooms with high air humidity. So, the method is perfect for decorating bathrooms and utility rooms. It will be possible to achieve an even surface if you follow the application rules and a certain order. Plastering the walls along the lighthouses will help in this difficult matter. It is quite possible to do it with your own hands.

						When leveling the walls, you can prepare mixtures yourself or buy ready-made ones available in hardware stores. According to their purpose and composition, they are divided into several groups: Clay compositions are mainly used for facing stoves and fireplaces. Slaked lime and sand are added here in small quantities. In rooms with low humidity, lime mixtures with the addition of cement are perfect. They have a long service life and low cost, therefore they are available to everyone. Cement-based plaster contains sand, the amount of which is regulated depending on the substrate intended for plastering. Other components may also be included (for example, lime to improve the elasticity of the solution). Gypsum mix is ​​considered more in demand. It is an environmentally friendly product that has good plasticity, does not shrink, and is resistant to temperature and humidity changes. It also allows air to pass through well, so the walls do not collect condensation. Now on the market there are different brands of gypsum plaster, intended for both indoor and outdoor work. Another feature of this material is quick adhesion to the working surface and ease of use.

						Choice of lighthouses For further work, the right choice of lighthouses is equally important. First of all, you should pay attention to the quality of the product. It should have a flat and smooth surface. Only in this way the plastering of the walls with the help of beacons will be done with high quality. They are made from various materials: Wood. They are used many times, but at present they are practically not used. Metal. These are relatively inexpensive and easy-to-use products. However, they have several disadvantages. Due to minor damage during operation, they cannot be reused, since the appeared rust can protrude on the surface of the walls. The most practical are lighthouses made of plastic or other similar material that is not inferior in its rigidity and strength. The only drawback of these devices is the high price. Craftsmen with extensive experience replace them with strips cut from drywall, pre-impregnated with a water-polymer emulsion. They are attached to the work surface using adhesives. Skilled craftsmen often use flood beacons. Plastering walls over gypsum beacons requires a lot of skill and skill, but the end result is worth it. The surface will acquire special strength and durability. Applying markings under the crate Before the installation of beacons for wall plastering begins, you should carefully prepare the base with your own hands. It is necessary to clean the surface from the peeled old plaster, remove dust and dirt with the help of improvised means. After that, the marking is carried out for fastening the profiles.{"\n\n"}

						Using the building level, you need to determine the places of the greatest drop in the walls. Vertical and horizontal markings are applied. At the intersection, you need to drill holes and hammer in dowels, and screw in self-tapping screws. Preparation of the working surface The next stage is the direct preparation of the walls for plastering. Using a brush, a deep penetration primer is applied, which will ensure strong adhesion of the solution to the working surface and reduce moisture penetration. After the walls are completely dry, you need to proceed to the establishment of profiles. During this moment, you should be extremely careful. The plaster of the walls on the lighthouses and the general appearance of the finished apartment will largely depend on this. Installation of beacons There are several ways of exhibiting: on a prepared solution or using special fasteners. First, you should prepare a small amount of the mixture, scatter it at the location of the profile, attach a beacon and press into the solution. In this case, it is recommended to check the correct location with a level.

						The next method of attaching beacons involves installing them at the place where the dowels and twisted fasteners are hammered. When the structure is leveled, it is required to finally fix the profiles by adjusting the thickness of the coating using self-tapping screws. Basis for cladding Plastering of walls on lighthouses is carried out on various surfaces with certain solutions and mixtures. For walls made of concrete, you can use a cement mixture with sand or lime, to which cement is added. To ensure better adhesion of the mortar to the working surface, it is recommended to make notches or use a reinforcing mesh. Plastering the walls with cement mortar on lighthouses is distinguished by its special strength and durability during operation.{"\n\n"}

						Any plaster is suitable for brick surfaces. But in order to save the mixture and money, it is worth giving preference to cement mortar. For plastering walls in wooden buildings, a reinforcing mesh must be attached before applying the working solution. It is intended for the strength of the connection between mortar and base. In this case, clay or gypsum-lime compositions are used. The most difficult for plastering are walls made of foam or aerated blocks. For them, a suitable solution is the use of gypsum or lime-gypsum compositions. Plastering After completing all the preparatory work, you should start preparing the solution. It is worth paying attention to the information from the packaging, otherwise incorrect ratios will lead to poor-quality work. Water is poured into the prepared container. Next, the mixture is poured and, using a special mixer, is brought to a homogeneous consistency. The density of the finished solution will depend on the height of the layer to be applied to the surface. In the work, you should use a large spatula, on which the mortar is laid out with a slight excess and applied to the wall. You can first sketch and then begin to level the walls with plaster along the beacons. The work must be done from the bottom up, keeping the rule perpendicular to the surface. It should be moved from side to side to distribute the solution evenly over the entire working area. Smooth out until the surface is smooth and even. If the plastering of the walls on the lighthouses is carried out for any finishing material, then the work is being completed. Painting and wallpapering requires removing it because there is a chance of rusting. In this case, the place where they were is carefully sealed with mortar and leveled. So, we found out how to plaster walls on lighthouses with our own hands. As you can see, the operation can be performed in different ways.
